# Front End Dev Portfolio

- React portfolio, a place to place all my projects and contact links and some info about me
- Has a dark mode feature for those late night viewers
- Used React js, bootstrap and some jquery to bring the portfolio to life
- Went for a minimalist approach on design, something clean
