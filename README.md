# Front End Dev Portfolio

- React portfolio, a place to place all my projects and contact links and some info about me
- Will add a blog section in the future for blog posts
- Has a dark mode feature for those late night viewers
- Used Adobe XD to design the look of the portfolio
- Used React js, bootstrap and some jquery to bring the portfolio to life
- Has a custom scroll bar
- Went for a minimalist approach on design, something clean
